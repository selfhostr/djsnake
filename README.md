## Overview

- **Plays what you paste.** YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Deezer and Apple Music links, live streams and radios, or plain text searches, in your voice channel.
- **A clip page next to the chat.** The bot posts a link to a page that shows the video in sync and controls the queue.
- **Free, for good.** MIT licence, no paid edition.

djsnake is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by YouTube, Spotify or Discord.

## Quick start

Try the [live demo](https://djsnake.selfhostr.io/demo/) first.

1. In the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create an application and add a bot. Enable the **Message Content Intent** and invite the bot with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes.
2. Deploy the prebuilt image (`ghcr.io/selfhostr/djsnake`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/selfhostr/djsnake.git && cd djsnake
cp .env.example .env        # set DISCORD_TOKEN
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

3. Join a voice channel and send `!play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...`. The bot posts the clip page link.

The clip page listens on `127.0.0.1:47823` by default. Put a reverse proxy in front and set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to share it. Back up `./data` with `python -m djsnake.backup create`. Details: [installation](docs/source/installation.md), [configuration](docs/source/configuration.md), [backup and restore](docs/source/backup.md).

## Features

- Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music playlists, albums and tracks are matched on YouTube with no account or API key ([Spotify](docs/source/spotify.md), [more sources](docs/source/sources.md)).
- Independent queue per server, loop, shuffle, optional crossfade, autoplay and a 24/7 mode.
- Automix: SponsorBlock cuts, loudness normalised to -14 LUFS, silence trimmed, fades.
- Audio filters, saved playlists, vote-to-skip and a DJ role.
- Every command works as `!name` and as a slash command ([commands](docs/source/commands.md)).
- Clip page: synced video, reorder and add tracks, lyrics from LRCLIB, listening stats, keyboard shortcuts, installable as an app, eight themes plus a custom one ([clip page](docs/source/clip-page.md)).
- Optional Last.fm scrobbling ([Last.fm](docs/source/lastfm.md)).
- English, French, Spanish and German, chosen per server with `!language`.
- Health check, optional Prometheus metrics, automatic backups.
- yt-dlp upgrades itself on start and a PO token sidecar handles YouTube's bot check ([keeping YouTube working](docs/source/youtube.md), [troubleshooting](docs/source/troubleshooting.md)).

Keyboard shortcuts, themes and more on the clip page: see [the clip page guide](docs/source/clip-page.md).

## Architecture

One Python process runs the `discord.py` bot and the clip page web server, with yt-dlp and ffmpeg for audio and video. A `pot-provider` sidecar supplies YouTube PO tokens. State lives in JSON files and SQLite databases under `DATA_DIR`. See [architecture](docs/source/architecture.md).

## Limits

- YouTube, SoundCloud and Bandcamp audio only. Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music links are matched to YouTube videos, so the match can be the wrong version of a song.
- Tracks are fully downloaded before they play, at most 720p. Playlists are capped by `MAX_PLAYLIST_SIZE` unless the requester picks the whole list.
- Age-restricted and members-only videos need YouTube cookies from a throwaway account.
- Anyone who has the control link can control the queue. Treat it as a secret.
- For personal use. Respect YouTube's Terms of Service and the rights of the people whose videos you play. The demo uses Creative Commons footage ([credits](docs/README.md#demo-footage-credits)).
